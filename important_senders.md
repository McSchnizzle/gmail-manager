# Important Senders & Priority Rules

## High Priority Senders

Always flag these as important:

- **sjb@silvix.org** - User's wife
- **wifey_at@yahoo.com** - User's mother

## Writing Style Notes

When analyzing sent emails to learn writing style:

**EXCLUDE these addresses** (work self-emails, not representative):
- paul@teamcinder.com
- pbrown@vital-enterprises.com

These are short reminder emails to self, not indicative of actual writing style.

## Intro Email Patterns

User frequently sends intro emails connecting two people. Look for:
- Emails with 2+ recipients
- Subject lines like "Introduction" or "Connecting [Name] and [Name]"
- Body structure that introduces both parties
- Usually includes context about why the connection is valuable

When user requests "intro [person x] to [person y]":
1. Gather info about both people (LinkedIn URLs or names/companies)
2. Find examples of user's past intro emails in sent mail
3. Match the structure and tone
4. Include both people (determine TO: vs CC: from examples)

## Communication Style Preferences

- Match user's natural writing style from sent emails
- Brief and professional by default, but adjust based on recipient/context
- Study sent emails to learn tone, common phrases, signature style
